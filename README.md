> Parse a set of LESS files, extract variables, and write to a JavaScript file.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the
[Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a
[Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.
Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-lessvars --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-lessvars');
```
